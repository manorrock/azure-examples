1. [Create an Azure App Service Plan](../../appservice/plan/create/)

## Build the example

To build the JAR file use the following Maven command line.

```shell
  mvn package
```

## Run example locally

To run the example locally use the following Maven command line.

```shell
  mvn quarkus:dev
```

You can see the application in action at http://localhost:8080/hello

## Deploy the example

To deploy the example use the following command lines:

````shell
  export JAVASE_QUARKUS_WEBAPP=javase-quarkus-$RANDOM

  mvn azure-webapp:deploy \
    -DappName=$JAVASE_QUARKUS_WEBAPP \
    -DappServicePlan=$APP_SERVICE_PLAN \

````

Once the command completes you will be able to see the example by using your web
browser and going to the ```xxxxx.azurewebsites.net``` address the command echoes.
